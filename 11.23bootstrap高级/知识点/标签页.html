            The affix plugin toggles between three classes, each representing a particular state: .affix, .affix-top, and .affix-bottom. You must provide the styles, with the exception of position: fixed; on .affix, for these classes yourself (inde
            pendent of this plugin) to handle the actual positions.
            Here's how the affix plugin works:
            To start, the plugin adds .affix-top to indicate the element is in its top-most position. At this point no CSS positioning is required.
            Scrolling past the element you want affixed should trigger the actual affixing. This is where .affix replaces .affix-top and sets position: fixed; (provided by Bootstrap's CSS).
            If a bottom offset is defined, scrolling past it should replace .affix with .affix-bottom. Since offsets are optional, setting one requires you to set the appropriate CSS. In this case, add position: absolute; when necessary. The plugin uses the data attribute or JavaScript option to determine where

            Use data attributes to easily control the position of the carousel. data-slide accepts the keywords prev or next, which alters the slide position relative to its c
            urrent position. Alternatively, use data-slide-to to pass a raw slide index to the carousel data-slide-to="2", which shifts the slide position to a particular index beginning with 0.
            The data-ride="carousel" attribute is used to mark a carousel as animating starting at page load. It cannot be used in combination with (redundant and unnecessary) expli
            cit JavaScript initialization of the same carousel.
